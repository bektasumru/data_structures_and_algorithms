Data Structures and Algorithms


A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data, while an algorithm is a method or process for solving problems. Together, data structures and algorithms form the foundation of efficient programming, and every developer should understand them.

This course will guide you through the essential concepts you need, including:

Algorithms

Recursion

Arrays and ArrayLists

Linked Lists

Stacks and Queues

Hash Tables, Hash Functions, and Hash Collisions

Time Complexity and Big-O Notation

Sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort

Searching techniques like Linear Search, Binary Search, and Binary Search Trees

Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your fundamentals, this content is designed to help you build a strong base in data structures and algorithms.
